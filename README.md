Mini Project: Tourism Sector Data Processing with Python, ETL, and SQL on Snowflake
Project Overview:
This project involves creating an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process within the tourism sector using Python, SQL, and Snowflake. You'll work with a sample tourism dataset, focusing on data ingestion, transformation, and analysis.
  Set Up Database Tables in Snowflake
    Create necessary tables in a Snowflake database.
    Load raw data from CSV files into the Snowflake tables.
  Data Transformation Using Python (pandas)
    Perform data transformations such as filtering, joining tables, and aggregating data using pandas.
    Load the transformed data back into Snowflake and export it as a new CSV file.
  Data Extraction and Statistical Analysis
    Extract the transformed data from Snowflake.
    Generate statistical insights from the extracted data.
    
Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Snowflake Database Setup
  Tools Required: Snowflake account, SnowSQL CLI or web interface, and a Python environment with the Snowflake connector.
  Tables to Create:
    Tourists: Tourist ID, Name, Age, Gender, Country of Origin.
    Bookings: Booking ID, Tourist ID (Foreign Key), Destination, Booking Date, Cost, Duration.
    Accommodation: Accommodation ID, Tourist ID (Foreign Key), Hotel Name, Check-in Date, Check-out Date, Rating.
  Data Ingestion:
    Use Snowflake's COPY INTO command or Python's Snowflake connector to load data from the provided CSV files into the Snowflake tables.
2. Data Transformation Using Python (pandas)
  Filtering: Extract bookings for tourists from specific countries or with booking costs over a certain threshold.
  Joining: Combine data from Tourists and Bookings to generate a comprehensive view of tourist activities.
  Aggregation: Calculate the total cost of bookings per tourist and the average rating of accommodations.
  Saving Transformed Data:
    Load the transformed data back into a new table in Snowflake called Tourist_Summary.
    Save the transformed data as a CSV file.
3. Data Extraction and Statistical Analysis
  Extract Data:
    Use SQL queries to retrieve the transformed data from the Tourist_Summary table in Snowflake.
  Statistical Insights:
    Generate statistics such as the average booking cost, most popular destinations, and the average duration of stays.
  Output:
    Save the statistical insights as a report (e.g., a CSV or text file).
   
Sample Data (Tourism Sector):
You can create or source sample datasets for Tourists, Bookings, and Accommodation. These datasets should include diverse entries representing various tourist demographics and booking behaviors.
Deliverables:
  SQL scripts for table creation and data loading in Snowflake.
  Python scripts for data transformation and extraction using the Snowflake connector.
  CSV files containing both the original and transformed data.
  A report containing the statistical insights generated from the data.
